Brian Hafley’s journey is a powerful testament to resilience and transformation. After serving time and graduating from a transitional living program led by Shane Reilly in June 2024, Brian rebuilt his life and now serves as a beacon of hope for others.

As the program’s dedicated case manager, Brian draws on his own lived experience to provide compassionate, personalized support—guiding participants through the challenges of employment and reentry, and inspiring them to envision a brighter future.
