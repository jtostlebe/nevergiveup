Shane Reilly’s life journey is a profound story of redemption and resilience. Born and raised in Wilmington, Delaware, Shane spent 30 years struggling with full-blown addiction and incarceration, with over 130 criminal entries across state and federal prisons. In total, he was incarcerated more than 10 times, facing repeated setbacks and challenges.

Determined to turn his life around, Shane committed himself to recovery, education, and transformation. He earned his Associate’s degree in Drug and Alcohol Counseling from Metropolitan Community College, a Bachelor of Science in Behavioral Science from Bellevue University, and, in 2025, a Master of Science in Mental Health and Wellness from Grand Canyon University.

Today, Shane channels his extensive lived experience and academic expertise into leading the Never Give Up Transitional Living program. As Program Director, he manages daily operations, oversees staff, ensures quality service delivery and regulatory compliance, and spearheads fundraising and community partnerships to sustain the program’s mission.

Driven by a passion to help others change their lives as he changed his own, Shane considers everyone who enters the program part of his family. He takes immense pride in mentoring participants and celebrating their successes as testaments to the power of hope, accountability, and second chances.
