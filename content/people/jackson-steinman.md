Jackson serves as a Peer Support Specialist, offering encouragement, mentorship, and a listening ear to program participants. His personal journey through incarceration and reentry allows him to connect with others in meaningful ways and offer support rooted in experience. 

After completing Shane's previous transitional living program in April 2024, Jackson chose to give back by helping others take their own steps toward stability and growth.
