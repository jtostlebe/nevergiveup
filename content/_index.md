      text: |
        <p style="color:#003366; font-size:1.125rem; line-height:1.6;">
        The Never Give Up Transitional Living program serves men released from prison who: (a) are approved for community supervision or parole, (b) are motivated to participate in structured reentry support, and (c) have applied to the program and completed a phone interview and background review.
        </p>
        <p style="color:#4D3B2F; font-size:1rem; line-height:1.6;">
        The overarching goal of the program is to reduce recidivism and promote successful reintegration by fostering personal accountability, community support, and access to essential resources.

        - title: The NGU Approach
          text: Never Give Up creates a supportive space where individuals with lived experiences (i.e., previously incarcerated) serve as mentors, helping participants navigate challenges related to addiction, antisocial thinking patterns, employment, and prosocial and community reintegration. By offering structured support, the program seeks to empower participants to rebuild their lives and achieve long-term stability.
