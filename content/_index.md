        <br>
        <c style="color:#4D3B2F; font-size:1.125rem;">The Never Give Up Transitional Living program serves men released from prison who: (a) are approved for community supervision or parole, (b) are motivated to participate in structured reentry support, and (c) have applied to the program and completed a phone interview and background review.
        
        The overarching goal of the program is to reduce recidivism and promote successful reintegration by fostering personal accountability, community support, and access to essential resources.</c>
